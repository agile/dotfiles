This is my 'vendor' directory

I keep third party repos of scripts and files checked out in here as submodules or svn repos and 
then symlink them back into the parent directory with relative symlinks. 

To update/initialize them, just..

  git submodule update --init

To update them from their upstream

  # if it's an svn repo, just svn up the path

  # else if it's a git submodule..
  cd path && git checkout origin/master && git pull 

  # if everything's nice and you want to make that stick
  # BE SURE THERE'S NO TRAILING SLASH.. or you'll overwrite the submodule with the actual files
  cd .. && git add path && git commit
