My common dot files...

Setting Up
----------
Run the install script to have them linked into place. The script will move any
existing files to an .orig extension so your orginal files should still be 
intact. It will also only create the symlink if the files are not already
symlinks.

linked_modules
--------------
This is a mount point for 3rd party repositories and thier files are symlinked
back into the paths of the dotfiles directory. I maintain the symlinks manually
as there are a case or two where I use my own version instead of upstream's.
